#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/e_xD5myanT4
#### Description:
This project is a simple To-Do List application built with React and JavaScript. The application allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface. The main objective of this project was to create a practical and functional tool for task management.

The app has three main features:
1. **Adding Tasks**: Users can add new tasks by typing them into the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.
2. **Editing Tasks**: Users can edit a task by clicking the edit button next to an existing task. The task can be updated with a new description.
3. **Deleting Tasks**: Users can delete tasks by clicking the delete icon next to each task.

The application uses local state management in React to handle the tasks, and each task is displayed in a list format. Tasks can be dynamically updated and removed in real-time without refreshing the page. 

This project demonstrates how to work with basic React concepts like state, events, and components, while also offering a practical and engaging user interface for interacting with a list of tasks.
